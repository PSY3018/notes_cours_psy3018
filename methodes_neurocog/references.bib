               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and
               summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.

              and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the
              many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols,
              comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this
              barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an
              international collaboration with the aim of developing a
              harmonized protocol for manual segmentation of hippocampal and
              parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this
              commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the
              associated key challenges involved in its development. These
              include differences among existing anatomical reference
              materials, striking the right balance between reliability of
              measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a
              versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of
              populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines
              these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each,
              with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two
              examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once
              completed, is expected to impact the field by producing
              measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and
              by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different

               Specifically, we segmented 5074 MR brain images into 138

               volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24

               comparing atrophy rates to published meta-studies. The approach
               enables comprehensive analysis of structural changes within the

              to that of the adult brain, but structures are immature, and the
              brain undergoes rapid growth during the first 2 years of life.
              Neonate magnetic resonance (MR) images have different contrasts
              compared to adult images, and automated segmentation of brain
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can thus be considered
              challenging as less software options are available. Despite this,
              most anatomical regions are identifiable and thus amenable to
              manual segmentation. In the current study, we developed a
              protocol for segmenting the amygdala and hippocampus in
              T2-weighted neonatal MR images. The participants were 31 healthy
              infants between 2 and 5 weeks of age. Intra-rater reliability was
              measured in 12 randomly selected MR images, where 6 MR images
              were segmented at 1-month intervals between the delineations, and
              another 6 MR images at 6-month intervals. The protocol was also
              tested by two independent raters in 20 randomly selected
              T2-weighted images, and finally with T1 images. Intraclass
              correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dice similarity coefficient
              (DSC) for intra-rater, inter-rater, and T1 vs. T2 comparisons
              were computed. Moreover, manual segmentations were compared to
              automated segmentations performed by iBEAT toolbox in 10
              T2-weighted MR images. The intra-rater reliability was high ICC
              $\geq$ 0.91, DSC $\geq$ 0.89, the inter-rater reliabilities were
              satisfactory ICC $\geq$ 0.90, DSC $\geq$ 0.75 for hippocampus and
              DSC $\geq$ 0.52 for amygdalae. Segmentations for T1 vs.
              T2-weighted images showed high consistency ICC $\geq$ 0.90, DSC
              $\geq$ 0.74. The manual and iBEAT segmentations showed no

  abstract = "Cortical surface area is an increasingly used brain morphology
              metric that is ontogenetically and phylogenetically distinct from
              cortical thickness and offers a separate index of
              neurodevelopment and disease. However, the various existing
              methods for assessment of cortical surface area from magnetic
              resonance images have never been systematically compared. We show
              that the surface area method implemented in FreeSurfer
              corresponds closely to the exact, but computationally more
              demanding, mass-conservative (pycnophylactic) method, provided
              that images are smoothed. Thus, the data produced by this method
              can be interpreted as estimates of cortical surface area, as
              opposed to areal expansion. In addition, focusing on the joint
              analysis of thickness and area, we compare an improved, analytic
              method for measuring cortical volume to a permutation-based
              nonparametric combination (NPC) method. We use the methods to
              analyze area, thickness and volume in young adults born preterm
              with very low birth weight, and show that NPC analysis is a more
              sensitive option for studying joint effects on area and
              thickness, giving equal weight to variation in both of these 2
              morphological features.",

  abstract = "The temporal characteristics of the BOLD response in sensorimotor
              and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
              tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated
              trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s
              and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to
              be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be
              predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular
              function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response
              varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this
              character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon
              model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
              concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
              temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
              measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
              individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was
              found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual
              rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the
              response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is
              effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The
              deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a
              short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may
              be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal
              blurring and may have potential applications in quantitating
              responses in eventrelated fMRI.",

              study the operational organization of the human brain, but the
              exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the
              underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present
              simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI
              responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and
              multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally
              resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from
              the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were
              observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by
              transient responses were the only signal that significantly
              correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems
              analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse
              response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and
              site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD
              responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest
              that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and
              intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking
              output.",
