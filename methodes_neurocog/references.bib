  abstract  = "Radiofrequency (RF) coils are an essential MRI hardware
               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and
               summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.

              has enabled in vivo research in a variety of populations and
              diseases on the structure and function of hippocampal subfields
              and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the
              many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols,
              comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this
              barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an
              international collaboration with the aim of developing a
              harmonized protocol for manual segmentation of hippocampal and
              parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this
              commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the
              associated key challenges involved in its development. These
              include differences among existing anatomical reference
              materials, striking the right balance between reliability of
              measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a
              versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of
              populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines
              these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each,
              with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two
              examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once
              completed, is expected to impact the field by producing
              measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and
              by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different
              studies. \copyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

               non-invasive in-vivo imaging of the human brain. We employed a
               recently validated method for robust cross-sectional and
               longitudinal segmentation of MR brain images from the
               Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
               Specifically, we segmented 5074 MR brain images into 138
               anatomical regions and extracted time-point specific structural
               volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24
               months. We assessed the extracted biomarkers by determining
               their power to predict diagnostic classification and by
               comparing atrophy rates to published meta-studies. The approach
               enables comprehensive analysis of structural changes within the
               whole brain. The discriminative power of individual biomarkers
               (volumes/atrophy rates) is on par with results published by
               other groups. We publish all quality-checked brain masks,
               structural segmentations, and extracted biomarkers along with
               this article. We further share the methodology for brain
               extraction (pincram) and segmentation (MALPEM, MALPEM4D) as open
               source projects with the community. The identified biomarkers
