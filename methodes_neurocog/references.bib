               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and
               summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.

              diseases on the structure and function of hippocampal subfields
              and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the
              many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols,
              comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this
              barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an
              international collaboration with the aim of developing a
              harmonized protocol for manual segmentation of hippocampal and
              parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this
              commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the
              associated key challenges involved in its development. These
              include differences among existing anatomical reference
              materials, striking the right balance between reliability of
              measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a
              versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of
              populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines
              these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each,
              with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two
              examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once
              completed, is expected to impact the field by producing
              measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and
              by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different

               longitudinal segmentation of MR brain images from the
               Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.
               Specifically, we segmented 5074 MR brain images into 138

               volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24

               their power to predict diagnostic classification and by
               comparing atrophy rates to published meta-studies. The approach
               enables comprehensive analysis of structural changes within the

              to that of the adult brain, but structures are immature, and the
              brain undergoes rapid growth during the first 2 years of life.
              Neonate magnetic resonance (MR) images have different contrasts
              compared to adult images, and automated segmentation of brain
              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can thus be considered
              challenging as less software options are available. Despite this,
              most anatomical regions are identifiable and thus amenable to
              manual segmentation. In the current study, we developed a
              protocol for segmenting the amygdala and hippocampus in
              T2-weighted neonatal MR images. The participants were 31 healthy
              infants between 2 and 5 weeks of age. Intra-rater reliability was
              measured in 12 randomly selected MR images, where 6 MR images
              were segmented at 1-month intervals between the delineations, and
              another 6 MR images at 6-month intervals. The protocol was also
              tested by two independent raters in 20 randomly selected
              T2-weighted images, and finally with T1 images. Intraclass
              correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dice similarity coefficient
              (DSC) for intra-rater, inter-rater, and T1 vs. T2 comparisons
              were computed. Moreover, manual segmentations were compared to
              automated segmentations performed by iBEAT toolbox in 10
              T2-weighted MR images. The intra-rater reliability was high ICC
              $\geq$ 0.91, DSC $\geq$ 0.89, the inter-rater reliabilities were
              satisfactory ICC $\geq$ 0.90, DSC $\geq$ 0.75 for hippocampus and

              T2-weighted images showed high consistency ICC $\geq$ 0.90, DSC
              $\geq$ 0.74. The manual and iBEAT segmentations showed no

              markers for diagnosing, tracking, and predicting progression of
              mental health disorders. Very few software algorithms provide
              more than measures of volume and cortical thickness, while more
              subtle shape measures may provide more sensitive and specific
              biomarkers. Mindboggle computes a variety of (primarily
              surface-based) shapes: area, volume, thickness, curvature, depth,
              Laplace-Beltrami spectra, Zernike moments, etc. We evaluate
              Mindboggle's algorithms using the largest set of manually
              labeled, publicly available brain images in the world and compare
              them against state-of-the-art algorithms where they exist. All
              data, code, and results of these evaluations are publicly

              and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
              tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated
              trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s
              and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to
              be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be
              predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular
              function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response
              varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this
              character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon
              model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
              concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
              temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
              measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
              individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was
              found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual
              rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the
              response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is
              effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The
              deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a
              short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may
              be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal

              responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and

               regions, including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral
               anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater
               activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This
               finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a
               network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this
               study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this
               hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human
               brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is
               it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these
               questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased
               activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined
               their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly
               coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in
               the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional
               connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and
               show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually
               identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three
               lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the
               cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We
               report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral
               prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for
               attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive
               processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first
               resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and

               of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide

  abstract  = "Recent studies have demonstrated large amplitude spontaneous
               fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the
               resting state. Importantly, these spontaneous fluctuations in
               blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often
               synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon
               termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is
               widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of
               fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks.
               Despite the large body of human imaging literature on
               spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting
               state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous.
               Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological
               recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations
               in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying
               locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with
               time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a
               traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at
               approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were
               reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either
               the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power
               changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the
               local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation
               between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal
               activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of
               correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in
               widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were
               significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single
               recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be
               generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based
               functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting
               state can be linked to synchronization of slow fluctuations in
