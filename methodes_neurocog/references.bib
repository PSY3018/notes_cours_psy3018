  abstract  = "Radiofrequency (RF) coils are an essential MRI hardware
               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and
               summarizes the current advances and developments in technology.
